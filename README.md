# Ada Constraint_Error: Array Index Out of Bounds

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada programming: the `Constraint_Error` exception raised when accessing an array element with an index outside its declared bounds.

The `bug.ada` file contains Ada code that attempts to access an array element using an invalid index, leading to the `Constraint_Error`. The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to prevent this error through input validation or exception handling.
